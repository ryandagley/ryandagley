- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ryandagley
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building cool solutions on AWS.
- I write a ton of SQL at work and I'm looking to expand my knowledge.
- Welcome to my codes.
- Challenging myself to Commit 100 days in a row (some code, some other exploration).
[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=ryandagley)](https://git.io/streak-stats)

Things I'm studying this week:
1. Python CDK
2. Planning out my projects

- Day 1: Wrote an OpenAI API connector.
- Day 2: Wrote an outline for OpenAI text summarization script.  Added some SQL for writing a table with dummy data.
- Day 3: I learned to write an AWS Lambda function that checks for S3 objects older than 7 days and e-mails me a list.  I was specifically curious to learn how to use S3 objects with s3.list_objects_v2.
- Day 4: I learned to deploy Day 3's Lambda function to AWS via CDK (not pushed).  This required guidance of a seasoned engineer who taught me how to structure my applications to use environment variables.
- Day 5: Continued focus on using environment variables with a Python CDK application.  I'm also having general difficulty with my Docker installation so will continue another day without pushing changes.  I'm gathering some questions to ask my engineering mentors when I see them this week.
- Day 6: Wrote a CDK application for creating S3 buckets.  I spent some time learning about deploying with "cdk deploy" and "npx".  I'm learning to be cautious about what I commit to Github with CDK as it seems it could be fairly easy to expose resources to the public that I would not want to.
- Day 7: Thrilled that I've completed a one week streak on commits!  Today I built the start of a portfolio page for my projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This will be the visual home for my ongoing projects.  In doing this I learned a little bit about the visual aspects of building a website to include playing a movie in the background and a button to turn music on and off.  At some point I'll want to host it on AWS and deploy using CDK (or similar).
- Day 8: Looking back on the past week, I'm realizing that I'm all over the place.  I think this is reflective of how things go at work.  I will benefit from planning out projects a bit more.  I've pushed a project proposal to my portfolio project to guide my next steps.
- Day 9: I just added a Github Stats widget and I'm graded with a C!  I've written some project plans for my portfolio project.
- Day 10: I'm planning the architecture for my portfolio project and leaning toward next.js.  I'm also writing some tests in python to test my SQL queries at work.
