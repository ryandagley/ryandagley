- Day 1: Wrote an OpenAI API connector.
- Day 2: Wrote an outline for OpenAI text summarization script.  Added some SQL for writing a table with dummy data.
- Day 3: I learned to write an AWS Lambda function that checks for S3 objects older than 7 days and e-mails me a list.  I was specifically curious to learn how to use S3 objects with s3.list_objects_v2.
- Day 4: I learned to deploy Day 3's Lambda function to AWS via CDK (not pushed).  This required guidance of a seasoned engineer who taught me how to structure my applications to use environment variables.
